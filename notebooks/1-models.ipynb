I should mention my capabilities, like answering questions, creating content, and assisting with various tasks. I should keep the tone friendly and open-ended to encourage further interaction. Let me make sure the response is clear and concise, avoiding any technical jargon. Also, I should check if there's any specific information the user might be looking for beyond the basic introduction. Maybe they want to know about my training data or use cases. I should invite them to ask more questions or share their needs. Let me structure the response step by step: greeting, introduction, capabilities, invitation to interact. That should cover it.\n",
